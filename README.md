# 🧪 Toxic Language Detection

Detecting toxic messages in online chat using machine learning and transformers.  
This project compares classic ML models and transformer-based models on the [Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) dataset.
